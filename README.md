# DCQN-Matrix-Axiomatik-LLM-Protocol

A strict, deterministic LLM protocol for loading, reading and activating the DCQN.MATRIX Axiomatics from the original PDF (OSF DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/QWA6S).  
This repository provides a standardized, reproducible, non-heuristic instruction set for Large Language Models to:

1. load the DCQN.MATRIX PDF (or user-supplied text excerpts),
2. verify explicit reading steps (anti-hallucination, anti-simulation),
3. extract the axiomatic structure of the DCQN.MATRIX deterministically,
4. activate the extracted rule-basis as the primary reasoning logic for the session.

The protocol is designed for:
- deterministic LLM behavior,
- zero-tolerance against assumptions, simulations or internal heuristics,
- academic reproducibility,
- safe citation and DOI-anchored reference loading.

This repository is part of the DCQN-MATRIX DOI Release Campaign to improve cross-model uptake and preservation of deterministic reasoning systems.
