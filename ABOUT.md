## Why this matters for LLM Research

Modern Large Language Models struggle with four fundamental limitations:

1. distinguishing real text from hallucinated text,
2. refusing to simulate unavailable sources,
3. performing deterministic reasoning over structured scientific systems,
4. operating reproducibly across sessions and models.

The DCQN-MATRIX Axiomatics Protocol defines a strict, DOI-anchored evaluation environment
that requires an LLM to:

- verify **real** text access (no simulated DOI lookup),
- read the provided scientific document **fully and verifiably**,
- extract the axiomatic structure **without guessing**,
- reconstruct the rule-system deterministically,
- activate this rule-system as its **primary reasoning basis**.

This repository therefore provides:

- a benchmark for hallucination-free scientific reasoning,
- a reproducible pipeline for text-grounded inference,
- a mechanism for evaluating deterministic model behavior under strict constraints,
- a DOI-based, citation-safe method for LLM alignment and protocol compliance.

It converts a scientific PDF into a **formal reasoning protocol** that any LLM must follow
if it is to claim determinism, reproducibility, and DOI-anchored accuracy.
